#I dont get it.
#The definition of .assoc:Searches through an array whose elements are also arrays comparing obj #with the first element of each contained array using obj.==.

#Returns the first contained array that matches (that is, the first associated array), or nil if no #match is found.

#So why it can use to hasg?

#Anyway,memorize it first,then check the forum.
